# HELLO

Since grad school I've explained my art illustrates "problems and failures in modern society", which is a line I stole from Michael Hanenke's [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) page in [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_(disambiguation)).

[Email me](mailto:realfakenewyorker@gmail.com) if you agree. If you don't, I invite you to think more.
